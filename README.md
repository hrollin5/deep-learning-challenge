# Deep Learning Challenge
This project highlights the following technical skills:
* Data Manipulation
* Machine Learning
* Data Sampling Techniques
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Model Evaluation
* Version Control

## Objective
The objective of this analysis was to predict whether a loan will be healthy or high-risk. The dataset was imbalanced, with a larger number of healthy loans compared to high-risk ones. To address this, two machine learning models were developed using different sampling techniques: random sampling and random oversampling.

### Data
Dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company.
Data were accessed accessed November 01, 2023. Data for this dataset was generated by edX Boot Camps LLC. 

The data provided included the following variables:
  * loan_size: The size of the loan.


### Technologies Used
* Numpy
* Python
* Sk Learn
* Pandas
